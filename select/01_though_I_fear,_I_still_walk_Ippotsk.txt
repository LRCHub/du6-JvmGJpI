All of the things
We hold so dear
Let's keep them close
For as long as we stay
Before my mind forgets it
And before my heart regrets
Let me put some words and notes
Together as you sleep
I'll join you in a bit

And yet the town moves
Ever so slow
As if one's in space
This world can still be
So beautiful
I wish I had just been
A little bit smarter

But before it comes (before it comes)
The day when I'm out of range (I'm out of range)
Though I fear, I still walk ahead
So thank you for all the colors
You've breathed into this life

Did you get some decent rest?
The weather's been not so friendly
Better days will surely come by
Sooner or later
But did you worry about me?
Might have been a fool, but frankly
"Better" ways don't always work for
Someone like me

Again the town moves
Ever so slow
As if one's in space
This world can still be
So beautiful
I wish I had just been
A little bit braver

But before it comes (before it comes)
The day when I'm out of range (I'm out of range)
Though I fear, I still walk ahead
So thank you for all the colors
You've breathed into this life
See you some other time

But before it comes (before it comes)
The day when I'm out of range (I'm out of range)
I still have to say my dues
So thank you for all the colors
You've breathed into my life
See you again somehow
